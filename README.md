## This software program can create randomized workouts and/or perform certain health calculations. 

The files included are in Assembly Language and C++ and link together to complete the package. 

The program receives user input through the C++ side, categorizes the input, and calls functions in assembly to do the majority of the work. 

### This program is capable of:
- Calculating BMI if given height in feet and inches, weight in pounds, and age
- Calculating base calories if given height in feet and inches, weight in pounds, age, and gender
- Creating 16 different randomized 4-movement workout plans for the chest, quads, hamstrings, and back
